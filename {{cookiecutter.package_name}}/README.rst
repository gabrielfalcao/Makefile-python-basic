Makefile for Python3 projects
=============================

Tired of switching between python development tools such as pipenv and
poetry I decided to stick to Makefile because it is available by
default in Linux and OSX.

Rationale
---------

- Makefile is available in most unix systems - ships with OSX and most Linuxes.
- Virtualenv is automatically created on demand via Makefile rules.
- Use pure pip to manage dependencies.
- Practice your GNU Make skills.
- No excuse for creating python projects without proper packaging and
  distribution structure, this repo gives you the blueprint for an
  installable python package ready for publishing to `pypi <https://pypi.org/>`_.


What is inside ?
----------------

The main file is obviously the Makefile, you can just download and use it however you want.

Optionally clone this whole repo which gives you the basic structure of an installable python package.

Makefile Targets
----------------

``make tests``
..............

Runs all tests.


``make unit``
.............

Runs unit tests.


``make functional``
...................

Runs functional tests.


``make black``
..............

Format code with black.


``make run``
.............

Executes the main command-line script.

``make release``
.............

Builds the current version and pushes to pypi.


**Setting up a new python project**
-----------------------------------

1. Clone this repo.
2. Delete the git information: ``rm -rf .git``.
3. Customize the variables in the ``Makefile``.
4. Customize the variables in the ``setup.py``.
5. Customize the ``cover-package`` variable in ``setup.cfg``.
6. Adjust the initial version in ``yourpackagename/version.py``.
7. Rename the folder ``yourpackagename`` to a valid python module name.
8. Replace the contents of this file ``README.rst`` (format documentation `here <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_).
9. Your project is ready for development, refer to the list of makefile targets above for more information.


**Configuring open-source license**
------------------------

1. Follow the `python packaging guide for licenses <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#creating-a-license>`_.
2. Edit the file ``LICENSE`` with a copy of the license you chose as explained in the guide above.
3. Edit ``setup.py`` with the proper `trove classifiers <https://pypi.org/classifiers/>`_ for the chosen license.


**Making a new release**
------------------------

Before making a release, make sure to configure your `pypi credentials <https://workshop-from-your-editor-to-pypi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pypirc-credentials.html>`_....

1. Set the new version in ``version.py``.
2. Add proper version changes in ``CHANGELOG.rst``.
3. run ``make release``.


**Adding docs**
---------------

I recommend using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ for documenting your project.

Sphinx is the unspoken official tool for documentation in the python
ecosystem, it supports many plugins but the `Intersphinx
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html>`_
plugin is among the ones I find most useful because it creates a
binary file called ``objects.inv`` that allows other Sphinx-powered
documentation to make direct reference to the documentation of
internal python APIs.
